## Abstract

This project investigates the application of expansion pathology microscopy (Ex-
Path) images , a novel high-resolution imaging technique, for advancing cancer
digital pathology. We hope to capture the intricate phenotypic features essential
for understanding tumor behavior and predicting drug response. Using statistical
methods as well as deep learning methods, we explore how different computational
tools can be used to address critical challenges in oncology, such as reducing
observer variability and improving the consistency and reliability of cancer diag-
nostics. By evaluating state-of-the-art architectures like ResNet18, DenseNet121,
and SqueezeNet, as well as segmentation and feature extraction methods, this work
highlights the role of image representation, model design and pre-processing steps
in achieving robust classification of tumor responses.
